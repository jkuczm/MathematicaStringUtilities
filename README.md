## Installation


### Automatic installation

To install StringUtilities package evaluate:
```Mathematica
Get["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jkuczm/MathematicaStringUtilities/master/BootstrapInstall.m"]
```

Note that this will also install
[ProjectInstaller](https://github.com/lshifr/ProjectInstaller) package, if you
don't have it already installed.

To load StringUtilities package evaluate: ``Needs["StringUtilities`"]``.


### Manual installation

1. Download latest released
   [StringUtilities.zip](https://github.com/jkuczm/MathematicaStringUtilities/releases/download/v0.1.0/StringUtilities.zip)
   file.

2. Extract downloaded `StringUtilities.zip` to any directory which is on
   Mathematica `$Path`, e.g. to one obtained by evaluating
   `FileNameJoin[{$UserBaseDirectory,"Applications"}]`.

### No installation

```Mathematica
Get["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jkuczm/MathematicaStringUtilities/master/StringUtilities/StringUtilities.m"]
```



## Compatibility

This package contains automatic test suite. Package is being tested with
Mathematica versions 8.0, 9.0 and 10.0 on Linux. Since it doesn't contain any
OS specific code it should work with above versions on all operating systems.

There's also no obvious reason for package not to work on earlier (6.0+)
versions of Mathematica.
